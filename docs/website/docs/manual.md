# Manual
PyMOL has an outdated user guide that can be accessed under 
this [link](https://pymol.sourceforge.net/newman/userman.pdf).
It was last updated around 2004 by Warren L. DeLano and Sarina Bromberg.

Despite being outdated, the guide offers some explanations on topics 
that are nowhere else covered to that extend.
